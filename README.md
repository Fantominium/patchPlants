progress thus far:
get current date
get 28 days after that
formated date
rendered all dates
created timeslot comps and the "day" state variable 
nail down booking logic for all dates, having them persist regardless of scrolling

TODO:
Still loads;
need to render 4 at a time (maybe through mycarousel)
logic to grey out days that all time slots are filled and display:none that day in the ui
lots of stylings
