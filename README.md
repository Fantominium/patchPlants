progress thus far:
get current date
get 28 days after that
format date
render all dates (need to render 4 at a time, maybe through mycarousel - will revisit after functionality)
create timeslot prop (only am for now, but that component will be replicated for pm and eve, just as it is)

TODO:
Still loads;
need to render 4 at a time (maybe through mycarousel)
logic to grey out days that all time slots are filled and display:none that day in the ui
lots of stylings
